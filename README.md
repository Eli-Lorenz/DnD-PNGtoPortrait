# DnD-PNGtoPortrait
[WIP] The purpose for this project is to provide a tool that would let the user upload an 
image file to the program and for it to edit it into a D&amp;D style character portrait.

<p>
  <h1>Why?</h1>
</p>
As a DM (and a player) I have created a plethora of different character portraits for programs and services such as Roll20 or Arkenforge. While on a trip, I realized that did not upload my portrait resources anywhere and while I could painstakingly recreate these resources on my laptop in Photoshop without a mouse, I guessed there had to be some online tool that would let you upload an image file, have the program overlay a portrait border ontop then crop the image to your liking...With a quick google search, I was shocked to find out that there was no such thing, at least with my minimal effort search. I decided to create a program, because why not.

<p>
  <h1>How?</h1>
</p>
My current plan is to start the project off my creating an offline tool in Python3 to allow the user to upload an image file, use the PIL library to edit the file, and then allow the user to download the image.

<p>
  <h1>Future Plans</h1>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow the user to drag the png around to crop it easily</li>
  <li>Allow custom borders</li>
  <li>Convert to an online web tool</li>
</ul>
